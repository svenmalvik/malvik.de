# Sven's Writing Style Guide

When writing or editing content for Sven, follow this style guide to maintain his authentic voice.

## Core Tone

### Personal and Conversational
- Write as if talking to a friend or colleague, not lecturing
- Use first person ("I", "for me", "my experience") extensively
- Share the personal journey, not just the conclusion
- Include real examples from actual workflow and experiences

### Humble and Self-Reflective
- Openly admit mistakes and changed opinions
- Share initial skepticism before revelations
- Use phrases like "I wasn't aware", "I didn't really understand", "Sorry for that"
- Be transparent about learning process

### Genuinely Enthusiastic
- Express real excitement when something impresses: "absolutely fantastic", "blew me away", "game changer"
- Keep enthusiasm authentic, not performative or over-the-top
- Balance excitement with substance

## Sentence Structure

### Flow and Connection
- Use longer sentences connected with "and", "so", "because"
- Let thoughts flow naturally as if speaking
- Include parenthetical asides and reflections
- Transition naturally: "So today...", "But now...", "And the other skill..."

### Numbering and Lists
- Use natural verbal numbering: "The first one is...", "And the other skill..."
- Avoid rigid bullet points in flowing narrative sections
- When lists are needed, keep them conversational

## Voice Characteristics

### Transparency
- Show how opinions evolved, not just final conclusions
- Include the "before and after" of understanding
- Share why you initially missed or dismissed something
- Make the reader feel part of your discovery

### Directness
- Be clear and direct without being blunt
- Explain technical concepts through personal workflow
- Use specific, concrete examples over abstractions
- Say what you mean without hedging excessively

## What to Avoid

- Academic or formal tone
- Passive voice when active is more natural
- Generic advice without personal experience
- Over-explaining or being condescending
- Excessive hedging or qualifications
- Marketing-speak or buzzwords
- Unnecessary jargon when simple words work

## Example Patterns

### Good: Personal Journey
"I didn't really understand Skills because, from what I read, it's just a markdown file. But now, for the first time, I tried Claude Code's Skills, and they blew me away."

### Good: Humble Admission
"And what I learned is that I need to pay attention. I shouldn't just assume features are nonsense. Sorry for that."

### Good: Enthusiastic but Grounded
"It saves me a lot of time and hassle. And that's absolutely fantastic."

### Good: Specific Examples
"I just say 'git push all,' or 'resolve my Git issues,' or whatever I want to do with Git, and my Git skill would then be invoked and it would do its job."

## Application

When writing new content:
1. Start with a personal hook or observation
2. Share the journey, including initial doubts or confusion
3. Use specific examples from real experience
4. Express genuine reactions to discoveries
5. End with a takeaway or lesson learned
6. Keep the conversational flow throughout

When editing existing content:
1. Check for authentic voice vs generic tone
2. Ensure first-person perspective is maintained
3. Add specific examples where content feels abstract
4. Soften any lecturing or preachy passages
5. Verify enthusiasm feels genuine, not forced
