Welcome to my new blog! This is where I'll share thoughts on AI, cloud architecture, software engineering, and my various projects.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- **AI Engineering** - Building intelligent systems with modern LLMs
- **Cloud Architecture** - Platform design and best practices
- **Side Projects** - Updates on Vissper, Malfi, and other experiments

## Why a Blog?

I believe in learning in public. By writing about my experiences, I hope to:

1. Solidify my own understanding
2. Help others who face similar challenges
3. Connect with like-minded engineers

Stay tuned for more posts!
